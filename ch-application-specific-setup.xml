	<para>PLMR users in the United States are mandated to move to 12.5 kHz narrowband communication in the 150-174 MHz VHF and 421-512MHz UHF bands by January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2018 for Industrial/Business and Public Safety respectively.</para>

<!--
	Background.  As noted above, the Second Report and Order imposed deadlines of January 1, 
2013 for licensees in the Industrial/Business Radio Pool and January 1, 2018 for licensees in the Public 
Safety Radio Pool to migrate to 12.5 kHz technology for PLMR systems operating in the 150-174 MHz 
and 421-512 MHz bands.

Second Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd at 3038 ¶ 12; 47 C.F.R. § 90.209(b)(5).  The bandwidth limitations 
apply to licensees in the listed bands “[u]nless specified elsewhere.”  47 C.F.R. § 90.209(b)(5).  We therefore 
clarify, as requested by LoJack Corporation, see Letter dated December 10, 2003 from Henry Goldberg to John B. 
Muleta, Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, that the mandatory migration date adopted in the Second 
Report and Order does not apply to stolen vehicle recovery systems (SVRS), because a 20 kHz bandwidth is 
specified elsewhere, specifically, in 47 C.F.R. § 90.20(e)(6).  Because SVRS systems operate on a frequency 
shared with Federal Government operations, however, the applicable migration date is at issue in ET Docket No. 
04-243.

	<para>If you live in the USA, it is highly recommended that you and your team get yourselves GMRS licenses to use with your radios. At the time of writing the licensing fee is $85 (per person) and the license is valid for five years. There is no exam involved and any legal resident of the US over the age of 18 can apply for a license.</para>
	<para>The following is a list of recommended GMRS channels suitable for Airsoft games, Paintball games, or other recreational military simulations:</para>

		<member><para>462.550 MHz (channel 15)</para></member>
		<member><para>462.575 MHz (channel 16)</para></member>

		<member><para>462.725 MHz (channel 22)</para></member>

	<note>
		<para>Channel numbers reflect a convention used by Motorola, actual mapping of frequency to channel number may vary between manufacturers.</para>
	</note>
	<para>For those not living in the USA, please contact your local regulatory body in charge of the radio spectrum to see what your options are.</para>
	<warning>
		<para>You may be tempted to use FRS (in the USA) or PMR446 (in Europe) frequencies while playing. Do note however that there are restrictions on both of these bands that make this transceiver illegal for use.</para>
		<para>Not only do you need a radio with a maximum of 500mW output power (the Baofeng UV-5R provides at minimum twice that), you also aren't allowed to use a radio with a detachable antenna or a radio that can be used outside of the FRS or PMR446 bands.</para>
		<para>In the US there is one exception to that rule, and that is FRS+GMRS combo units, however they are still restricted to 500mW output power on the FRS frequencies, and they still have to be manufactured with a fixed integral antenna.</para>
