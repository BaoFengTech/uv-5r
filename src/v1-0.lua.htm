				<h2>The (Chinese) Radio Documentation Project</h2>
				<p>Version 1.0 is merely a re-write of the original Baofeng UV-5R manual. Hopefully without the grammatical errors. In upcoming revisions we plan to go above and beyond the scope of the original manuals, to bring you the manual these radios need.</p>

			<h2>Roadmap</h2>
			<p>For version 1.0 we intend to have a complete rewrite of the original manual.</p>
			
			<p>Around Version 1.5 we plan to have the programming chapters finalized.</p>

			<p>For version 2.0 we hope to have been able to put the unit under extensive testing in order to bring you the most in-depth and accurate manual you could imagine. Also, if we can find someone with the appropriate skills willing to help us out, a very stylish front cover.</p>

			<p>Of course, there will be incremental minor releases between 1.0 and 2.0, with minor updates along the way.</p>
