			<h2>Roadmap</h2>
			<p>For version 0.9 we intend to have a complete rewrite of the original manual, but without the polish. Version 0.9 will be crude but functional.</p>
			
			<p>Version 1.0 will be the same as v0.9, but <em>with</em> the polish. Unlike v0.9, v1.0 will have graphics for things such as menu selections and things like that.</p>
			
			<p>For version 2.0 we hope to have been able to put the unit under extensive testing in order to bring you the most in-depth and accurate manual you could imagine.</p>
