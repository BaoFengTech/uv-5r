			<h2>Roadmap</h2>
			<p>For version 1.0 we intend to have a complete rewrite of the original manual.</p>
			
			<p>Around Version 1.5 we plan to have the programming chapters finalized.</p>

			<p>For version 2.0 we hope to have been able to put the unit under extensive testing in order to bring you the most in-depth and accurate manual you could imagine.</p>

			<p>Of course, there will be incremental minor releases between 1.0 and 2.0, with minor updates along the way.</p>
