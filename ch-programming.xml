		<title>CHIRP</title>
		<para>A popular alternative to the manufacturers own software, is the open source and cross platform programming tool <link xlink:href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/">CHRIP</link>. If you're a user of Apple OS X or a flavour of Linux, CHRIP may very well be your only option to programming your radio via computer.</para>
		<warning>
			<para>At the time of writing, CHRIP only supports the Baofeng UV-5R in nightly builds. Earlier builds may possibly brick your radio.</para>
		</warning>
		<note>
			<para>CHIRP does not currently have the functionality to program optional features such as ANI. To access these functions you'll have to use a computer running Windows with the Baofeng software.</para>
